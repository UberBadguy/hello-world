# hello-world

Mario Leon here, I studied .NET, Oracle and Java on DuocUC while working toward my Informatics Engineering degree (4th year as of now).
I have a lot of time working projects on Unity3D (mine and from students) when i was a project leader on a Innovation Center on DuocUC, Chile, and made 2 sites using PHP, Codeigniter, Bootstrap and MySQL. Right now im learning Laravel, Wordpress, and Ruby on Rails to get better chances of a good job so i can learn a lot of new things and forge myself as a good professional.

Hobbies: Iaido, Kendo, Guitar playing.
